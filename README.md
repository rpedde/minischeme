Playing around with building a r5rs-ish scheme.  In addition to being
a stupid re-implementation of the wheel, it also suffers from not
being very round.

I don't encourage anyone to look at this -- this amount of stupid
concentrated in one place may very well cause physical discomfort (or
even death).  I'm comfortable with it, I've been operating at this
level of stupid for some time.

You may not have the acclimation necessary to operate at this level.
Consider yourself warned.
